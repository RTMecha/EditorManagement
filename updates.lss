1.8.1 > [Jun 16, 2023]
- Mod is integrated with my own modified version of Catalyst that works in the editor. I've sent that version off to Reimnop so we'll see if the changes get implemented soon.
- Fixed a problem with pasting an object causing the multi object editor window to open.
- Added a config option for render depth, so you can now have the Legacy render depth "cap" or the unlimited render depth.
- Fixed a bug where creating a new level wouldn't load the level properly.
- Fixed a bug with Search Object window resetting the Multi Object Editor value not allowing objects to be synced.
- Fixed a bug with prefabs not being copy-able (this also now means that prefab objects can be included in prefabs potentially).
- Cleaned up the old Prefab Object dialog code.
- Changed the way the image shape type is used in editor. (Instead of manually inputting the local path of an image, you can now click on the magnifying glass icon and be taken to a open file search window where you will be able to find any image anywhere)
- If the event types count goes higher than normal, it will be sent into the next event layer. This requires EventsCore to use.
- Fixed a problem with themes with small ID's not saving to level.lsb.
1.8.0 > [May 29, 2023]
- Done a ton of bug fixing and code optimization.
- Added a few more tooltips.
- Began implementing some ObjectModifiers stuff. Much like EventsCore, you will need EditorManagement in order to use the editor stuff for ObjectModifiers. Otherwise that mod is fine to use on it's own.
- Fixed Legacy waveform color combining (the colors of top and bottom parts of the waveform should now mix if they overlap)
- Added Fast waveform type for each already existing waveform type. It's called "Fast" because it might be more optimized, but I am unsure.
- Tried fixing an issue where loading prefabs saving prefabs wouldn't create the z axis.
- Clicking on a theme keyframe and rendering the theme list should be a little quicker now.
- Made copied objects save to AppData/LocalLow/Vitamin Games/Project Arrhythmia/copied_objects.lsp so if you have any separate instances of PA you can copy from one instance to another.
- Pasting objects now properly offset from the current audio time.
- Fixed an issue where letting the audio play whilst pasting a bunch of objects would offset the start time of each object constantly to the current audio time, rather than a set audio time from when you first pasted.
- Drag selecting a group of objects, pasting objects and deleting objects are now faster.
- Added a delete level function to the Open Level Popup. When the delete button is clicked, it will bring up a warning asking if you want to delete the level or not.
- Made a new Warning Popup window that shows whenever you're trying to quit to menu / quit game, delete a prefab, delete a theme or delete a level like the above feature.
- Fixed a bug where clicking on Create Backgrounds would create 1 extra background.
- Added a "Delete All Markers" button to the marker list. This does the same thing as the Delete All Backgrounds button (plus now both bring up the Warning Popup).
- Themes will no longer reload when a level is loaded due to them being loaded on editor start. If you need to reload the themes, you can click on the refresh button.
1.7.12 > [May 11, 2023]
- Changed Sync to First Selected Object in the Multi Object Editor to use the Search Objects function.
- Fixed an old issue where the zoom wouldn't load properly.
- Fixed the bug where exiting and re-entering the editor would break the custom editor GUI theme.
- Minor bug fix for prefabs not being able to change layers using the multi object editor.
- Fixed an issue where creating a new object wouldn't create the z axis for position keyframes.
1.7.11 > [May 10, 2023]
- Fixed pos Z axis breaking prefabs. They now properly render.
- I tried fixing the event drag selection issue where you can't drag select from the new event rows, but it hasn't been working at all for some reason.
- Added a config option for the sound that plays when you hover over a UI element. Find it in Editor Preferences > Editor GUI > Hover UI Sound.
1.7.10 > [May 5, 2023]
- Made the text input field for text objects bigger, allowing you to see 3 lines in total.
- Clicking on specific input fields with the scroll wheel on the mouse will invert the numbers in that input field. Only works for Depth and Keyframe input fields.
- Hitting Ctrl + V while hovering over an input field will paste from the clipboard. Though again this only works for the previously mentioned input fields.
- Added some more hover elements.
- Added a little flip sound effect that plays when you hover over some elements, though if you don't like this I can add an option for it next update.
- Added an Object Search popup, allowing you to look for specific objects without needing to search endlessly throughout the layers.
- Fixed an issue where the preview theme didn't have the extra 9 object color slots.
- Moved the create theme to the start of the theme list so it's easier to access.
- Fixed an issue where saving a theme wouldn't save the alpha hexcode, instead saving it the normal way.
- Fixed creating a new beatmap theme not having all the colors.
- Added Z axis to position keyframes. This works for both single objects and parenting and is compatible with render depth. (Think of render depth as Origin Z Offset)
- Added some more tooltips.
- Did a small change to the way Editor GUI Colors find objects of a specific color.
- Implemented a Color Picker for Editor Preferences settings that have color values. To access the Color Picker, click on the colored square next to the hex code.
1.7.9 > [May 3, 2023]
- Added 9 more color slots for any theme to use! If a theme doesn't already have 9 slots, the extra color slots will just use the last color slot in that theme.
- Somewhat fixed the prefab search bug, but I will probably need to optimize it a bit better.
1.7.8 > [May 2, 2023]
- Fixed an issue where randomization wouldn't show.
- Added extra event dialogs for EventsCore to use. EventsCore will not work in the editor without this.
- Cleaned up the object editor, so now origin offset and render depth input fields match other input fields.
- Added a lock toggle next to the start time input field, so now locking objects is easily accessible / readable.
- Fixed an issue where selecting more than 1 keyframe wouldn't allow the object editor to update.
- Hopefully fixed the issue where creating a new level didn't create anything.
1.7.7 > [Apr 8, 2023]
- Implemented EventsPlus, cleaning up the code I had written for it.
- Fixed the issue where scrolling on an input field with the scroll functionality and going into negative numbers would make the number go all crazy. It now acts as expected.
- Themes can now have transparency in player, gui and object color slots and themes will now only save to a level if any theme event keyframe contains the theme id.
- Alongside EventsPlus, NewThemeSystems and PrefabAdditions were also implemented. The PrefabAdditions implementation introduces internal prefab creation, so you don't need to flood your external prefab files with random misc one-off prefabs.
- Added a template "Example" prefab and theme that comes internally with the mod. The prefab will always be added to the internal prefabs unless you go into Editor Preferences and turn the setting off.
- The object drag selector now moves to the currently selected object keyframe and when clicked, it will automatically set the cursor time to the keyframe time.
1.7.6 > [Apr 7, 2023]
- Added song encryption, so uploading a level will now convert the level.ogg file to a "song.lsen" file, which cannot be played as an audio file due to it being encrypted. This is good to use with ArcadiaCustoms.
- Added a few more hover ui stuff.
- Added an option for the timeline cursor to not pause when dragged around.
1.7.5 > [April 7, 2023]
- Trying to fix the timeline cursor so it doesn't pause when you drag.
- Fully implemented and did some changes to how the implemented mods work. (That's RenderDepthUnlimited and OriginOffset). Because of this, use the mod with caution when making levels until we're sure we can use it without the game breaking.
- Added template theme config stuff.
1.7.4 > [Apr 4, 2023]
- Fixed a bug where prefabs weren't taken into consideration with multi object selection.
- Added two more config settings: Snap Keyframes and Snap Amount. Snap keyframes now allows you to BPM snap the time of keyframes when you drag them and Snap amount is basically the timing of the song (I think, Idk music that much)
- Prefabs can now have their timeline object collapsed.
- Fixed a zoom bug where selecting an event keyframe would cause zooming in / out to not work.
- Fixed zooming for the object keyframe timeline, so now it'll (most of the time) zoom in on the cursor position. Doesn't do this all the time, and I have no idea why.
- Added hover scaling to open file popup buttons, timeline objects and object keyframes. The scale setting can be modified via the config.
1.7.3 > [Apr 3, 2023]
- Moved all the code in mods RenderDepthUnlimted, OriginOffset, CursorColor and NoAutokillSelectable to EditorManagement. It's pretty much the same exact code as before, but I do plan on stream-lining it to make it work a whole lot better.
1.7.2 > [Apr 3, 2023]
- Added the rest of the Config Settings for EditorManagement.
1.7.1 > [Apr 3, 2023]
- Fixed an issue with creating new levels not working.
- In the future I plan on combining other mods with this one(like RenderDepthUnlimited, OriginOffset and NoAutokillSelectable) just so it's easier for me to work on the mods, and it just makes sense overall to do that since all of those mods do stuff with the editor.
- Started working on a Editor Properties window! This will replace ConfigurationManager as a more PA-style GUI thing.
1.7.0 > [Mar 31, 2023]
- Added some custom notifications for me to use.
- Notifications' width, size and direction can now be modified in the config.
- Added an option for saving date_edited in the metadata to be the most recent.
- Added "Delete All Backgrounds" button to the BG window. This will do exactly as it says, except for keeping one object due to problems occuring if a BG object doesn't exist (I think). Oh and there's a "Create Backgrounds", so you can add a specific amount of random backgrounds.
- Added a clear parent button, so you can now easily reset an objects' parent to nothing.
- Added a TON of tooltips.
- When hovering your mouse over an object or clicking on one (and if Debug is enabled in config), it will display a notification related to the object's data, including current position.
- You can now drag the first positition keyframe of an object around. This feature is very experimental but it works enough for me to have it here.
- The layer input field will now change when you scroll wheel over it. When you press the middle mouse button, it will send a notification listing all the layers that have an object.
- Added more functionality to the scroll wheel stuff for the object keyframes, although there is a minor bug with it atm and Idk why it happens. (It's just where going into the negative numbers would make it jump to a weird number)
- Markers now show a tooltip relating to what their name, time and description is.
- Changed some config stuff so it's a little more readable.
- Certain UI popups can now be dragged around.
- Gave more popups / dialogs animations, but they have more settings that can be modified via the config (which include custom easings).
1.6.2 > [Mar 29, 2023]
- Fixed an issue where an unused feature got in the way of loading the level list properly.
1.6.1 > [Mar 26, 2023]
- Fixed prefab deleting, now you should be able to delete prefab objects (Not the ones that come from an expanded prefab).
- Fixed the timeline and object zooms, so now it will only zoom if your mouse is hovered over the timeline. (This also means I fixed the event layer timeline zoom issue)
- Made the Level Open Popup do the thing it does in dev+.
1.6.0 > [Feb 27, 2023]
- Removed waveform external loading, caused a few issues so unfortunately it had to be removed. Still saves into your level folder though!
- Fixed applying prefab selection bug.
- Added deleting objects to undo! Even when you delete a ton of objects, you can undo that.
- Deleting, pasting, drag selecting and expanding prefabs now runs 10x as fast, although at the cost of it appearing to happen instantaneously. Works similarly to deleting event keyframes where it deletes them one by one.
- Drag selection now allows you to multi select by holding SHIFT and drag selecting more objects.
- Implemented a custom EditorGUI theme system so now you can really customize the colors of the editor.
- Fixed instant keyframe easing so now it should actually be instant.
1.5.7 > [Feb 22, 2023]
- Fixed an issue where expanding and applying a prefab would cause the whole editor to error.
1.5.6 > [Feb 19, 2023]
- Added some configurable editor preview stuff. You can now highlight selectable objects, show empty objects, show only damagable objects, set objects not on current layer as transparent and set empties not selectable in preview.
1.5.5 > [Feb 19, 2023]
- Added a scroll viewport to the Multi Object Editor to allow for more options.
- Added multi object name, swap / toggle lock / collapse and sync actions.
- Added BPM Snap saving.
1.5.4 > [Feb 16, 2023]
- First release for GitHub! This update contains no changes other than adding a "date edited / created" sort option in the sort dropdown for the editor level list popup.
1.5.3 > [Feb 10, 2023]
- Fixed the custom waveform stuff.
- Waveform now saves and if it already exists, it will load from the level folder. Else it will just generate a new one, which I think will make the level loading take longer. If you don't want a waveform timeline, you can just disable generation in the config.
- Did some minor changes.
1.5.2 > [Feb 9, 2023]
- Fixed creating new levels and loading icons from directories.
- Started potentially implementing a waveform saver / loader system? Idk how to cache stuff yet so this'll hopefully be a thing in the future when I get that going.
1.5.1 > [Feb 7, 2023]
-Replaced editor layer buttons with an input field and changes the way layers and objects are handled to allow for practically as many editor layers as you could want.
-Added more game difficulties, but I might move this to a separate mod later so you don't need to have EditorManagement in order to have the extra difficulties.
-Added multi object editor, you can now select a group of objects and affect them in a certain way!
-Made a bunch of stuff configurable (Open File Popup, waveform colors, autosaves, etc)
-Added custom editor path so you can load the level list from any directory in the beatmaps folder.
-Added editor level list sorting.
-Brought back Save As.
-Autosaves now save in beatmaps/editor level path/autosaves.
-Fixed a few name issues where you can't type spaces when naming prefabs and when naming themes you're forced to have the first letter of each new word be a capital and not have any other symbols like numbers.
-Added extra level details in the settings window, such as object count, alive objects count, time in editor, etc.
-Added marker looping so you can loop between two markers.
-Last editor position (layer, timeline scrollbar, audio time, zoom) now saves and loads each time you open a level, allowing you to easily continue where you last left off.
-Added a button that takes you to the artist link you set.
-Added a little doggo!
1.5.0 > [Feb 5, 2023]
- Added some stuff to the multi object editor window, including: set depth, set layer, set time, cycle object type and set song autokill time to current song time.
- It's now possible to customize the directory you load levels from. However currently it won't reload in-game atm so for now the feature's not accessible.
- Cleaned up an error log spam issue when going into preview mode.
- Fixed up the Save As feature, now you can save a copy of your current level to beatmaps/editor, including sub-directories!
1.4.5 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Fixed pasting objects on layers higher than normal.
- Fixed selecting objects on layers higher than normal.
1.4.4 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Fixed an issue with autosave constantly running whenever the camera zoom is being updated. 
1.4.3 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Fixed a minor issue with Event/Check using the old way of setting the layer.
1.4.2 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Added the layer input field to the beatmap object editor window.
- Fixed an issue relating to if an object is at a higher editor layer than the layer button count, so now you can have the object on any layer you want! :D
1.4.1 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Changes the layer input field to feel a bit more familiar with how PA usually is.
1.4.0 > [Feb 3, 2023]
- Added editor level list sorting via a dropdown list and checkbox.
- Added optional difficulty colors to each level button.
- Added Hover Help Tooltips to each level button, containing artist - title (with the base name being the difficulty color) and the description.
- Added a loading doggo! Isn't he cute?
- Time spent in specific level now loads and saves to and from editor.lse.
- Current layer, main timeline zoom and main timeline scroll all get loaded and saved to and from editor.lse.
- Added open artist link button next to the link type dropdown in the metadata window.
- Added the two new difficulties as properly selectable options. ("None" difficulty is the animation difficulty)
- You can now have as many editor layers as you want, however objects above layer 9 won't render correctly due to a similar issue to that custom objects bug that was fixed in Image Shapes.
1.3.1 > [Jan 7, 2023]
- Fixes error log spam when in Editor Preview mode.
1.3.0 > [Jan 3, 2023]
- Fully implements the Count values to the Settings window. Still unsure if this is entirely stable.
- Finally adds custom level button text formatting.
- Fixes an issue where when you drag the timeline cursor the game pauses. (Not entirely fixed yet)
- Adds timeline pos save so if the config is enabled, loading a level with a saved timeline_pos value will automatically set the audio time to it on start. This can be saved and also be modified via the config menu.
- Brings back the normal time button (the one that tells you the current minutes:seconds.milliseconds of the level).
- Removes the check button from the timeline bar because it's pretty useless.
- Fixes the new marker colors not rendering and shows the current marker's index number at the bottom through some text.
- Cleans up the config, which means previous versions of the config file won't be read.
1.2.3 > [Dec 19, 2022]
- Adds a Object Count text object to the Settings window. This does exactly what you think it does, it shows the current amount of objects the current level has. It automatically updates as you add more objects AND it updates when you switch to another level.
1.2.2 > [Dec 17, 2022]
- Adds marker looping so you can easily stay within the bounds of a selected area. This could be really helpful for collabs or for focusing on certain parts of a level. (I'm legit going crazy over this due to it being another old suggestion of mine that never happened)
1.2.1 > [Dec 15, 2022]
- Replaces the original time button with a time text InputField.
1.2.0 > [Dec 14, 2022]
- Adds config options like the recent Prefab Additions updates, allowing you to customize the Open File Popup window.
1.1.1 > [Dec 10, 2022]
- Adds config options for the editor zoom limit, so you can now zoom out even further!
1.1.0 > [Dec 9, 2022]
- Adds two new difficulties to the game: Master and animation. Metadata difficulty 5 is Master and 6 is Animation. If the mod isn't used OR the number is higher than what the mod allows, the difficulty just becomes "Unknown Difficulty".
1.0.0 > [Dec 3, 2022]
- Currently this mod adds config to the repeating AutoSave function. Mod can't increase the autosave count yet. Future versions of this mod will allow for custom beatmap folders.
