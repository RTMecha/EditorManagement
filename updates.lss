- Fixed some issues with deleting objects.
- Pasting and expanding prefabs should now be a little bit faster.
- Added another inspect button for those who use UnityExplorer.
- Event / Check layer keyframes now have their sprites render at the correct offset, meaning they're can now look like they're properly aligned with the audio time.
They also now use the object keyframe sprites method, meaning they will use the appropriate "in/out/inout" easing sprite.
- Added a Game Timeline preview so you can finally see what animations you're doing to it while in-editor.
- Prefab Type icons now render with the collapse / lock icons for objects that are connected to a prefab and for prefab objects. This can be disabled in Editor Properties / Preferences
