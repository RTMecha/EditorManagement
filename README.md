# EditorManagement
EditorManagement aims to make the Project Arrhythmia (Legacy) editor more powerful than ever.

Features this mod contains:

-New layer system that allows you to go well beyond 5 editor layers.


-More tooltips.


-Level list that can load from any directory within "application path/beatmaps" and can be sorted by different types such as level name and artist name.


-Configurable settings for all kinds of editor UI stuff.


-Adds extra difficulties (Master and animation), however this might eventually be moved to a separate mod for those who don't want all the editor stuff but want the difficulties.


-Makes the settings dialog (window) more useful where it shows a ton of information about the currently loaded level. (E.G. object count, time in editor, text object count, etc)


-Adds marker looping so you can loop between a set end marker and a set start marker.


-Adds Multi Object editor with options to change the group selected objects layer, depth and more.


-Little reminder pops up at a set repeat time to remind you to have a break :)


-Fixes save as so it now properly works, including bringing back the old save as UI elements.


-Brings back the unused internal new level popup brower.


-Fixes naming of prefabs and themes, now allowing you to type in names any way you want. (Prefabs use to not allow spaces and themes used to require the first letter of each word to be uppercase AND didn't allow numbers or other symbols.


-Autosave changes, can now be customized at a set repeat rate and file limit. Autosaves now save in "level path/autosaves" rather than just "level path".


-Adds a button to the metadata editor that takes you to the song artist link you set.


-Last editor position (Layer, timeline scrollbar, audio time, zoom) now saves to "level path/editor.lse" and can also load from there whenever you open a level. (Audio time savess to "level path/level.lsb")
